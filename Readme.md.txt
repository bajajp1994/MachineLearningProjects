Machine learning projects with python will help to learn how to use 
the power of Python to analyze data, create beautiful visualizations, 
and use powerful machine learning algorithms!.
Theses projects are based on topics:
* Programming with Python
* NumPy with Python
* Using pandas Data Frames to solve complex tasks
* Use pandas to handle Excel Files
* Web scraping with python
* Connect Python to SQL
* Use matplotlib and seaborn for data visualizations
* Use plotly for interactive visualizations
* Machine Learning with SciKit Learn, including:
* Linear Regression
* K Nearest Neighbors
* K Means Clustering
* Decision Trees
* Random Forests
* Natural Language Processing
* Neural Nets and Deep Learning
* Support Vector Machines
and much, much more!
In these projects, We will:
* Use Python for Data Science and Machine Learning
* Use Spark for Big Data Analysis
* Implement Machine Learning Algorithms
* Learn to use NumPy for Numerical Data
* Learn to use Pandas for Data Analysis
* Learn to use Matplotlib for Python Plotting
* Learn to use Seaborn for statistical plots
* Use Plotly for interactive dynamic visualizations
* Use SciKit-Learn for Machine Learning Tasks
* K-Means Clustering
* Logistic Regression
* Linear Regression
* Random Forest and Decision Trees
* Support Vector Machines
